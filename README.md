# cse237-project

- To start game, go to /pong and type 'gradlew desktop:run'
  - If that doesn't work, it's likely something to do with your Java install (JRE or JDK).
  - If it doesn't work on windows, and you have java installed, check your environment variables.
- To develop with an IDE, LibGDX highly recommends InteliJ, I tried to use Eclipse for a couple hours and couldn't get it to import and build. I got InteliJ working using the Desktop instructions here: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Intellij-IDEA
